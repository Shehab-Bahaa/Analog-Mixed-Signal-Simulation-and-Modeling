# Analog-Mixed-Signal-Simulation-and-Modeling
This repository is a documentation of my lab submissions for the AMS simulation and modeling Training of Siemens EDA in Summer 2022, delivered by Dr. Hesham Omran.  
The labs involved the following topics:  
  - Understanding and practicing SPICE simulations.  
  - How does a simulator work: Build your own simulator!  
  - MOSFET modeling and short channel effects.  
  - Analog IC design automation.  
  - Analog IC design optimization.  
  - PLL design and simulation.  

In each lab directory, there will be the following:  
  - the lab requirements (pdf file)  
  - My lab report for the procedures, results, and snapshots (pdf file)  
  - the relevant SPICE netlists and Matlab scripts
